imageProcessing_iOS
===================

A small iOS app that makes use of OpenCV to adjust the brightness of a picture, by simply adding to the image, or subtracting from it a fraction of the image itself (depending on the position of the slider)

The value of the UISlider indicates the level of brightness.
